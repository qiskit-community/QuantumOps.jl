This package implements types representing single-particle Pauli and fermionic operators and
their composition into terms and sums.

Types implemented include single-qubit(fermion) Pauli(fermionic) opearators,
mulit-qubit Pauli(fermionic) operators, and linear combinations of multi-particle operators

Examples of several applications are implemented. These include: converting to and from matrix
representations; Jordan-Wigner transformation.
